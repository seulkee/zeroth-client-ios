# Zeroth Speech-To-Text library for iOS 

**Zeroth** was initially developed as part of Atlas’s **Conversational AI platform**, which enables enterprises to add analysis and intelligence to their conversational data. Visit our [homepage](https://zeroth-cloud.goodatlas.com/) for more information.

We now introduce Zeroth Cloud as a hosted service for any developer to incorporate speech-to-text into his or her service.

We'd love to hear from you! Please email us at [`support@goodatlas.com`](mailto:support@goodatlas.com) with any questions, suggestions or requests.



## Features

- Real time speech-to-text
- Change sample rate between 16000 and 44100



## Requirements

- iOS 10.0+
- Xcode 10.0+

  

## Usage

First thing is to import the header file. See the Installation instructions on how to add Zeroth to your project.

```objc
#import "ZerothSpeechToText.h"
```

Once imported, you can create a connection to zeroth WebSocket server with your authentication info. Set  the delegate as well. Optionally, sample rate and buffer size can be configured. The default sample rate is 16Khz and send default buffer chunk in every 250ms. 

```objc
self.zeroth = [ZerothSpeechToText new];
self.zeroth.delegate = self;

// setup sample rate (optional) - default 16 KHz
[self.zeroth setupSampleRate:z16000];

// setup buffer size in second (optional) - default 250 ms
[self.zeroth setupBufferSizeInSecond:0.25];

// setup authentication
[self.zeroth setupAuthenticationAppID:@"ENTER_YOUR_APP_ID"
                            AppSecret:@"ENTER_YOUR_APP_SECRET"
                             Language:zKorean 	//"zKorea" or "zEnglish"
                            FinalOnly:NO];
// connect to zeroth STT server 
[self.zeroth connectZerothSocket];
```

After you are connected, there are some delegate methods that we need to implement.

### zerothSocketDidConnect

```objc
- (void)zerothSocketDidConnect {
    NSLog(@"socket is connected");
}
```

### zerothSocketDidDisconnectWithError

```objc
- (void)zerothSocketDidDisconnectWithError:(NSError*)error {
    NSLog(@"zeroth socket is disconnected: %@", [error localizedDescription]);
}
```

### zerothSocketDidReceiveMessage

```objc
- (void)zerothSocketDidReceiveMessage:(NSString*)string {
    NSLog(@"got some received zeroth result in json: %@", string);
}
```

### zerothSocketDidReceiveData

```objc
-(void)zerothSocketDidReceiveData:(NSData*)data {
    NSLog(@"got some binary data: %d",data.length);
}
```

The delegate methods give you a simple way to handle data from the server while the socket activities are occured.  

### connectZerothSocket

```objc
[self.zeroth connectZerothSocket]; // create connection to zeroth server
```

### disconnectZerothSocket

```objc
[self.zeroth disconnectZerothSocket]; // disconnect from zeroth server
```

### startZerothSTT

```objc
[self.zeroth startZerothSTT]; // start listening from mic and send buffer to zeroth server 
```

### stopZerothSTT

```objc
[self.zeroth stopZerothSTT]; // stop listening and disconnect zeroth socket 
```

## Dependency Management & Instructions

- The recommended approach for installing Zeroth is via the CocoaPods package manager (like most libraries). Create empty `Podfile` or use command `pod init` to generate default `Podfile` Then add following pod info.

  ```
  pod 'zeroth-private'
  pod 'jetfire', :inhibit_warnings => true
  ```

- Remember to modify the .plist file to get user's authorization for using the microphone, of course the `<String>` value must be customized to your needs, you can do this by creating and modifying the values in the `Property List` or right-click on the `.plist` file and `Open As` -> `Source Code` and paste the following lines before the `</dict>` tag.

  ```
  <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Your microphone will be used to analyze voice data </string>
  ```

- Create developer account and generate AppID and AppSecret - the app credential at https://zeroth-console.goodatlas.com 

- Connect UI and create simple functional logics  

- In order to be able to run project, you need to have iOS 10.0+.

- **Build and Run the app!**

- More detailed instructions in the code comments.
